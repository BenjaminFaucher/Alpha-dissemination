The findings of this study are based on metadata associated with a total of 1,735,675 sequences available on GISAID and submitted between 15 Aug 2020 and 1 Jun 2021 included and downloaded on 2 Jun 2021 via gisaid.org (GISAID: EPI_SET_230724tv). To view the contributors of each sequence associated with the metadata we used, visit https://doi.org/10.55876/gis8.230724tv. Some collection date are missing.

We use daily number of COVID-19 cases by country from the COVID-19 data repository hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (CSSE).

Proprietary airline data are commercially available from OAG and IATA databases.

This repository is divided in three parts.

The `Data Processing` folder contains the code to process data described just before and to compute inputs for `IDM`
The `IDM` folder pertains to the International Dissemination Model.
The `AMA` folder contains the code to run AMA model.
